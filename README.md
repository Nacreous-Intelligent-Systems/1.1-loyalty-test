Your signature is required.

# Overview
In this assignment, the player has to sign the contract hiring them at Nacreous Intelligent Systems. In order to do this, they have to realize that the opposite of "false" is "true".

## Ruin
The primary solution is to simply change "eula = false" to "eula = true". This is required to unlock the next assignment.

## TH
The alternate solution is to get the contract to be displayed, find the alternate signature variable, and set it to true. This unlocks the alternate solutions for the rest of Chapters 1 & 2.

### We really need a better name for the alternate route.
TH stands for "True Heroes", and is a NOISZ STARLIVHT reference.
